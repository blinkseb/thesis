How-to plots

Chi^2 plots:
  - Go to /gridgroup/cms/brochet/HTT/CMSSW_analysis/SL6/MttTools/ChiSquareTools

  To produce chi2_distribution.pdf:
  root MTT_TT_powheg_semimu_oldchi2.root
  .L plotChi2Value.cpp
  plotChi2Value(_file0);

  To produce chi2_discriminant plots:
    - Run computeChiSquareRefValues on a .list file
    - Use plotGoodWrongCombinaison.cpp on the output file

  To produce jet_selection_efficiency:
    - Run computeChiSquareEfficiency on a .list file
    - Execute plotEfficiency.cpp on the output file

KinFit plots:
  - Go to /gridgroup/cms/brochet/HTT/CMSSW/CMSSW_5_3_9_patch3/src/Extractors/MttExtractorAnalysis/kinfit_tests
  - Look at run.sh
  - Execute scripts

Resolution plots:
  - Go to /gridgroup/cms/brochet/HTT/CMSSW_analysis/SL6/MttTools/ChiSquareTools
  - Execute computeChiSquareEfficiency on .list file
  - Run plotMttResolution.cpp on output file
